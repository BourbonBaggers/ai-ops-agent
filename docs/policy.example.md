# Marketing Standards Policy (Tuesday Email Machine)

## 1. Purpose
Produce one weekly B2B marketing email that is helpful, concise, professional, and relationship-oriented.

The objective is awareness and engagement, not urgency or aggressive selling.

---

## 2. Voice & Tone

- Practical and confident
- Friendly but not casual
- Clear and direct
- No hype language
- No corporate jargon
- Written for busy professionals

Emails should feel like they were written by a competent operator, not a marketing intern.

---

## 3. Hard Rules (Never Violate)

- No emojis
- No em dashes
- No excessive punctuation (!!!)
- Never discuss pricing, margins, wholesale terms, or discounts
- No artificial urgency ("last chance", "act now") unless explicitly tied to a real calendar event
- No unverifiable claims (e.g., "best", "guaranteed", "#1")
- Do not reference internal operations or private conversations

---

## 4. Subject Line Guidelines

- Target length: 30–55 characters
- Clear benefit + mild curiosity
- Low-to-medium hook intensity
- Avoid spam-trigger words (FREE, URGENT, ACT NOW, etc.)
- No clickbait or deception

Examples of acceptable tone:
- “New assets for next month”
- “What’s working right now”
- “Fresh demo content available”

---

## 5. Preview Text (Preheader)

- 60–90 characters
- Should complement the subject line
- Must not repeat the subject line verbatim
- Should clarify value, not exaggerate it

---

Target length: 120–220 words (excluding footer)
